>You're out for a walk with your very chatty friend. Conversation is one thing, but this friend just never stops chattering on, bouncing from topic to topic faster than you can think. You'd better pay attention, though, or you won't be friends anymore. And you can hardly afford to lose a friend. On the other hand, don't forget to watch where you're going, or you might get run over by a car.

Walk and Talk was initially developed as an entry for My First Game Jam: Summer 2017.
